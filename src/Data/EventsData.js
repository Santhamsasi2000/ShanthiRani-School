        desc:"'ALL Work and NO Play makes Jack a Dull Boy'. Educational trips range from local visits to civic offices or businesses to international excursions, complete with overnight stays. We Shanthi Rani believes whatever their scope, Educational trips can offer many advantages to our students. They are benefitted from Educational trips by gaining new perspectives on the world. This is especially true for more extensive Educational trips where students travel farther away from home. By coming into direct contact with a different environment or even a new culture or language, students can better understand their place in the community and develop openness to differences in others. Our 12th standard children were taken to Trivandrum; 10th and 11th standard children were taken to Kanyakumari. Our KinderGarten kids were taken to Karaikudi park as a one day picnic."
