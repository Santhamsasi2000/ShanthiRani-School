         <li>To check regularly their Notebooks, School Diary, and Progress Report, and to take adequate measures for the progress of their children.</li>
         <li>Parents only have the rights to contact the School regarding any issue.</li>
         <li>To contact the Principal from time to time, to discuss with her matters connected with the conduct and academic progress of their children.</li>
         <li>To make necessary arrangements to have their children taken back home immediately after school hours.</li>
         <li>To supplement classroom teaching with a certain amount of guidance at home, especially through conversation in English.</li>
         <li>Not to contact teachers or students during class hours.</li>
         <li>Parents are requested to leave the children and go before the Assembly starts.</li>
         <li>No child suffering from any contagious or infectious disease will be allowed to attend the school.</li>
         <li>Parents or guardians are allowed to meet the class teacher of their children to enquire about their progress from 4:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. on working days.</li>
         <li>The School does not guarantee the success of a pupilâ€™s studies unless his/her parents co-operate with school authority and do their part in forcing regularity and discipline.</li>
